    "**R-Squared**: With an R-squared value of 0.176, the model explains 17.6% of the variation in the dependent variable. This leaves 82.4% unexplained, as the model does not account for it.\n",

    "- **R-Squared**: The value of 0.176 tells us that the model as a whole only explains 17.6% of the variability in the dependent variable. So, while the model may be statistically significant, it doesn’t capture much of the outcome’s variability, suggesting that a large amount of the variability in the dependent variable remains unexplained.\n",
    "\n",

    "The difference between the two statements is that R-squared measures how well the entire model explains the outcome, while p-values and coefficients indicate how much specific predictors matter in influencing the outcome, regardless of the model’s overall performance."

    "Model 3 focuses only on Attack and Defense to predict HP; however, this doesn't fully capture the complexity of the data. The hypothesis testing shows that these variables have a significant impact, but the in-sample R-squared value (0.1477) is relatively low, suggesting that the model doesn't capture much of the variance in HP. This indicates that the model is likely underfitting the data by not accounting for enough complexity in the relationship. Model 4 attempts to improve this by adding more predictors and interaction terms to capture more relationships between these variables and HP. As seen, the in-sample R-squared (0.4671) has improved compared to Model 3. The increase in the in-sample R-squared suggests that the model has gained more predictive power. However, the out-of-sample R-squared (0.0025) dropped dramatically compared to Model 3, suggesting severe overfitting. The model performs very well on the training data but fails to generalize to the test data. In Model 5, some of the interactions from Model 4 were removed to avoid overfitting, but it still includes more predictors than Model 3. The in-sample R-squared (0.3920) and out-of-sample R-squared (0.3002) values show that the model is not as overfitted, and the out-of-sample performance is significantly better than Model 4's. This demonstrates improved generalizability. Model 5 represents a more balanced approach."
